## AqAsyncLoader
Allows apps to display information to users while async content is loading

## Features
Developers can control what to show while content is loading

## Usage
Add widget to page
Add an expression that determines whether the content has loaded
Add content to show while loading is taking place
Add content to show when loading is complete
(optional) add an action that can perform the background loading (e.g. from a microflow). If you don't use this then you need to control a change somewhere that will result in the expression evaluating to true at some point
